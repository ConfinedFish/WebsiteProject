                Valencia is one of Spain's 17 administrative regions. The paella and oranges from this region are more known than its wine. Located on Spain's east coast, it is Spain's third-largest and the Mediterranean's largest port. The Valencia Denominacion de Origen wine title covers 13,000 hectares (32,000 acres). Clarino lies about 65 kilometers to the southwest of Valencia produces red wines made from the Monastrell, Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot grape varieties which are the specialty there.
